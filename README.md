PSI Projekat

This is a group project built as homework for our Principles of Software Engineering class at School of Electrical Engineering at University of Belgrade.

Our web app enables students that need help to create a notice, with detailed explanation of what they struggle with, which subject is their problem related to, 
and they also have the option to attach a zip file containing all necessary class material that the tutor needs to help the student. Tutors can create their CV 
and export it to PDF format. They can request to collaborate on a notice, and if collaboration is ended successfully, then student and tutor both can rate, 
and optionally comment, the other party involved in their collaboration. Every user has their own profile where their collaborations, comments about them, and 
their average rating are displayed.

Everything is built using Django, while the frontend look is enhanced by Bootstrap CSS. We used mySQL for our database.

Along with our app, which is in 'aplikacija' directory, in other directories is everything else related to the project, like use case and sequence UML diagrams, 
use case specification documents, database specification document, ER diagram, Selenium IDE tests, and much more.
